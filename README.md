1.Label encoding is a technique used to convert categorical variables into numerical representations. In this encoding scheme, each unique category is assigned a unique integer label. Label encoding is appropriate when the categorical variable has an inherent ordinal relationship, meaning that the categories can be ranked or ordered.

Here's an example to illustrate the label encoding process:

Suppose you have a categorical variable "Color" with the following categories: "Red," "Blue," and "Green." After label encoding, the categories might be represented as:

Red: 0
Blue: 1
Green: 2
Label encoding can be easily implemented using various programming libraries. For instance, in Python, you can use the scikit-learn library's LabelEncoder class to perform label encoding.
2.Ordinal encoding is another technique used to convert categorical variables into numerical representations. It assigns unique integers to each category, similar to label encoding. However, ordinal encoding also takes into account the order or rank of the categories, which makes it suitable for variables with an inherent ordinal relationship.

Here's an example to illustrate the ordinal encoding process:

Suppose you have a categorical variable "Size" with the following categories: "Small," "Medium," and "Large." After ordinal encoding, the categories might be represented as:

Small: 0
Medium: 1
Large: 2
Ordinal encoding is typically performed by manually assigning the integer labels based on the order of the categories. The assigned labels should reflect the inherent ordering of the categories.
3.One-hot encoding is a popular technique used to convert categorical variables into a binary vector representation. It creates new binary columns (also known as dummy variables) for each unique category in the original variable, where a value of 1 indicates the presence of that category and 0 indicates its absence.

Here's an example to illustrate one-hot encoding:

Suppose you have a categorical variable "Fruit" with the following categories: "Apple," "Banana," and "Orange." After one-hot encoding, the categories might be represented as:
    Apple  Banana  Orange
0   1      0       0
1   0      1       0
2   0      0       1
3   0      1       0
4   1      0       0
